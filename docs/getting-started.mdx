1. Create a new wall at [https://app.vouchpanel.com](https://app.vouchpanel.com). Add some tweets to the wall using the `Import Tweets` button.

2. If you are using VanillaJS, click `Embed Wall` and copy the snippet to your website. If you are using a frontend framework, follow the specific instructions for your framework:

<br />

- [React](/docs/react)
- [Vue](/docs/vue)
- [Angular](/docs/angular)
- [Svelte](/docs/svelte)
- [Vanilla JS](/docs/vanilla)

That's it! We statically render your Wall and cache it with our CDN. Your wall should take between 3 and 5ms to load.
