Welcome!

### Why Vouchpanel?

Well, after founding a few startups, we have seen firsthand how testimonials are overlooked. The issue is online testimonials are a big pain to:

- **_Manage_** (spreadsheet, airtable, amazon reviews, etc.)
- **_Implement_** (custom javascript, css, react, and vue)
- **_Update_** (update the website, blog, and marketing materials)

That's why we started Vouchpanel. A simple service to be the single source of truth for your reviews. Vouchpanel comes out of the box with beautiful components that automatically update with your top reviews.

### Are testimonials that important?

As you may not know (don't worry, we didn't either), testimonials are an incredibly important part of any business:

- 72% of consumers say positive testimonials and reviews increase their trust[^1]
- 70% of people trust reviews and recommendations from strangers[^2]
- 92% of customers read online reviews before buying[^3]
- 97% of B2B customers cited testimonials and peer recommendations as the most reliable type of content[^4]

Yet they are such a pain in the \*\*\* to manage, implement, and update. We want to be your online testimonial martyr.

### So what's first?

We have a large roadmap, but we are starting with twitter testimonials. Vouchpanel will filter your twitter mentions and presents the most articulate reviews of your product with minimal configuration.

We integrate with React, Vue, Svelte, Webflow, Shopify, and plain JS. [Try it out!](https://app.vouchpanel.com/)
